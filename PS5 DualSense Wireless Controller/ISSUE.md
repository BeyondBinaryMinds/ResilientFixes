# Repairing a PS5 DualSense Wireless Controller

## 📅 Date: September 18, 2025 - 1:21 PM

I was all set to play Apex Legends when my PlayStation 5 DualSense controller stopped charging after a fall from my bed. I tried multiple Type-C cables, but nothing worked.

If you’ve ever looked at a PS5 controller price, you know they start at $59.99 (sometimes $37 if you find a deal hopefully its not a lemon). As a student, money is tight—I didn’t want to spend another $60 on a controller that came with my console. Instead, I decided to repair it myself!
