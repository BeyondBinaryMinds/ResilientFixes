## 🛠️ **Solution**  
1. **Assessed Damage** – Checked if the LCD was cracked internally or just had external damage.  
2. **Researched Repair Parts** – Apple charges **$600**, so I looked for DIY options.  
3. **Found a Compatible Diplay Replacement** – Located a third-party screen for **$250** @ Newegg.  
4. **Replaced the Screen** – Used IFIXIT PRO Kit to detach the broken screen and install a new one.  

## 💰 **Total Cost: ~$250 (vs. $900 from Apple!)**  
By taking this DIY approach, I saved my friend **$600** while learning valuable repair skills! 🚀
