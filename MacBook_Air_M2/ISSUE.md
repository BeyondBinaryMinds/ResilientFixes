# MacBook Air M2 Issue  

## 📅 Date: March 26, 2025 - 9:00 PM  

After a trip to dunkin', my friend and I returned to her place. We sat down on the sofa, and she opened her **MacBook Air M2 (13-inch, 2022)**—only to discover that the screen was glitching and cracked!  

This was the **second time** the cats had bitten it. As a student, money is tight, and spending **$600 or 900 on a repair** wasn’t an option. Instead, I stepped up with a **cheaper alternative—me!**  

That moment sparked something—a **goal to fix technology** and help others facing similar issues.
