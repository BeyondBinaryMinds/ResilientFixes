# MSI Modern 14 C13M Repair
🛠️ Solution
Assessed Damage – Checked broken screen casing, screen hanging off bolts, cracked keyboard frame, missing keys (including Delete and Spacebar), pushed-in trackpad, and non-working webcam.

Researched Repair Parts – Professional repair was expensive (~$500+), so I searched for affordable DIY replacement parts.

Found Replacement Parts – Ordered a black chassis bottom panel, full keyboard assembly, trackpad, screws, and frame parts online.

Repaired & Upgraded – Used iFixit Pro Kit to disassemble, replaced damaged chassis parts, installed new keyboard and trackpad, and upgraded to the black chassis for a fresh look.

💰 Total Cost: ~$150 (vs. $500+ professional repair!)
Doing it myself saved hundreds and gave this trusty laptop a full makeover before graduation! 🚀
