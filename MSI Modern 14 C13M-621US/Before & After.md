#💻 MSI Modern 14 C13M – The Indestructible Survivor Makeover
📅 Date: August 2025
This MSI Modern 14 C13M has been my ride-or-die since August 2023. It has survived drops, cracked frames, missing keys, and enough daily wear to send most laptops to the recycling bin. Yet here we are in 2025 — it still works like a champ.

With my final semester of college ahead, I thought about upgrading to something new. But this laptop has been so reliable that instead, I’m giving it the ultimate transformation — new look, new parts, and a full refresh to keep it running strong for years to come.
