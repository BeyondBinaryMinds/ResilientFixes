# 💻 MSI Modern 14 C13M – The Indestructible Survivor Makeover

## 📅 Date: August 2025

This **MSI Modern 14 C13M** has been my ride-or-die since **August 2023**. It has survived drops, cracked frames, missing keys, and enough daily wear to send most laptops to the recycling bin. Yet here we are in 2025 — it still works like a champ, just with a little *character*.

With my **final semester of college** ahead, I thought about upgrading to something new. But this laptop has been so reliable that instead, I’m giving it the **ultimate transformation** — new look, new parts, and a full refresh to keep it running strong for years to come.
